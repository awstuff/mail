# mail
This was intended to be a web based email client (smtp and imap). Unfortunately, it had to be abandoned due to problems with imap that I was not able to solve.

The client is built with React.js and Material UI.
The server is built with Node.js.

The server code includes a customized version of the nodemailer library (https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer).

This repository features very few commits, because it is a copy of the original one. Due to privacy reasons, the original has to stay private.
